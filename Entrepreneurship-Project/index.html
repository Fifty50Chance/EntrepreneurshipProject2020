      <h4 style="text-align:center;">Summary of the Water Roller</h4>
      <p style="text-align:center;">The Water Roller is an easy-access product designed to transport clean water. The Water Roller resembles the shape of a wheelbarrow. The purpose of the Water Roller is to provide a temporary relief from crises such as the Flint Water Crises. The water can be transported from a source, such as a community center, to places such as senior shelters or one's own home. The water transported will stay clean while inside the water roller, which is also designed to not contaminate the water even in heat or other stressful conditions. Another use of this product can be to help people caught in a natural disaster, who may be in the process of moving to a new home or do not have access to fresh water. Since the Water Roller has wheels, it can easily be moved around even in times like those. One last usage of the Water Roller is to help places such as Africa, where clean water may be scarce. Volunteers and other people trying to help the community can easily bring fresh water straight to the impoverished community through the usage of the Water Roller.</p>

      <h4 style="text-align:center";>The design of the Water Roller</h4>
      <p style="text-align:center";>The container of the Water Roller is made of ABS plastic. What differenciates ABS plastic from PET plastic (commonly used for plastic water bottles) is that ABS plastic has low water absorbtion, so it is very unlikely that the water within the Water Roller will be contaminated. The handle of the Water Roller is made of steel, and there is a foam grip to prevent burns from the metal, and also provide a stronger grip. The axles of the Water Roller are made of steel, and the wheels are made of the standard material. The Water Roller is specifically designed in order to keep the water as pure as possible for the longest amount of time, while remaining resistant to outside sources.
